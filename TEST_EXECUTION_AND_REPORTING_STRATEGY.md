# Test Execution and Defect Reporting Strategy: Amazon Listing Optimizer

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**
This document outlines the conceptual strategy for executing planned tests and for reporting and tracking defects discovered during the Quality Assurance (QA) process for the Amazon Listing Optimizer application. It aims to provide a clear framework for how manual testing will be conducted and how issues will be managed through their lifecycle.

**References:**
This strategy is based on the following documents:
*   `TEST_PLAN.md`: Defines the overall testing scope, objectives, and resources.
*   `FUNCTIONAL_TEST_CASES.md`: Contains detailed functional test cases to be executed.
*   `NON_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_APPROACH.md`: Describes the approach for usability, localization, basic security, and performance observation.
*   `QA_SCOPE_DOCUMENT.md`: Details what is in and out of scope for QA.

## 2. Test Environment Setup (Recap)

*   **Local Development Environment:** Testing will primarily occur within the local development environment orchestrated by `docker-compose`. This setup includes:
    *   The `frontend` service (React application served via Nginx).
    *   The `backend` service (FastAPI application).
    *   The mock `db` service (PostgreSQL), though direct database interaction testing is minimal for the current MVP.
*   **API Key Configuration:** The backend's `.env` file must be correctly configured with valid (test/development) API keys for Amazon Product Advertising API (PAAPI) and OpenAI to enable testing of integrations that rely on these external services. SP-API credentials will use placeholder/mock values.
*   **Browsers:** Testing will be performed on the latest stable versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

## 3. Test Execution Process (Manual)

Given the current stage of the project, test execution will be primarily manual.

### 3.1. Functional Test Execution:
*   **Procedure:** QA will systematically execute the test cases documented in `FUNCTIONAL_TEST_CASES.md`.
*   **Preconditions:** Before executing each test case, the specified preconditions will be met.
*   **Steps:** Test steps will be followed precisely as documented.
*   **Recording Results:**
    *   Actual results observed during execution will be recorded against the expected results for each test case.
    *   Any deviation will be noted.
*   **Status Marking:** Each test case will be marked with a status:
    *   **Pass:** Actual result matches the expected result.
    *   **Fail:** Actual result deviates from the expected result. (A defect should be logged).
    *   **Blocked:** The test case cannot be executed due to an external factor or a blocking defect in another part of the application.
    *   **Skipped:** The test case is intentionally not executed in a particular cycle (e.g., due to changed requirements or environment limitations).

### 3.2. Non-Functional Test Execution (Integrated with Functional Testing):
Non-functional aspects will be evaluated concurrently with functional test execution.
*   **Usability Testing:**
    *   While performing functional tests, QA will actively observe the UI/UX against the heuristics defined in `NON_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_APPROACH.md`.
    *   Usability issues, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement will be noted and reported (potentially as lower severity defects or suggestions).
*   **Localization (i18n) Testing:**
    *   A significant subset of critical path functional test cases will be executed in both English and Arabic.
    *   **Language Switching:** The language switcher functionality will be explicitly tested for seamless transitions.
    *   **Translation Spot Checks:** Key UI elements in Arabic will be spot-checked against `frontend/src/locales/ar/translation.json` and for general appropriateness as per `KSA_LOCALIZATION_GUIDELINES.md`.
    *   **RTL Layout Verification:** During tests in Arabic, careful attention will be paid to RTL layout integrity (text alignment, component flow, icon positioning, no visual overlaps).
*   **Basic Security (Conceptual Review):**
    *   This is not active vulnerability testing. It involves reviewing the application's adherence to the principles in `COMPLIANCE_BEST_PRACTICES.md` based on observations during functional testing (e.g., how error messages are displayed, ensuring no API keys are visible in frontend requests).
*   **Performance (High-Level Observation):**
    *   During all functional tests, QA will remain observant of the application's responsiveness.
    *   Any significant lags, freezes, or unusually long loading times (initial app load, API call responses for PAAPI/OpenAI) will be noted and reported for investigation.

### 3.3. Test Data Management:
*   The test data identified in `TEST_PLAN.md` (e.g., valid/invalid ASINs, sample product details in EN/AR, KSA-specific keywords) will be used.
*   Test data will be varied as needed for specific test cases to ensure adequate coverage (e.g., testing with different product categories for ASIN fetching, using long strings or special characters in manual inputs).
*   For features like "User Optimization History," test data will be generated by performing several optimization cycles.

## 4. Defect Reporting and Tracking (Conceptual)

*   **Defect Definition:** A defect is any variance between the actual and expected results of a test case, or any instance where the application does not meet specified requirements, usability heuristics, localization standards, or exhibits undesirable behavior.
*   **Reporting Mechanism:**
    *   For this project stage, if a formal bug tracking system (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla) is not in place, defects will be logged in a shared document, such as a markdown file named `DEFECT_LOG.md`.
    *   **`DEFECT_LOG.md` Template (Conceptual - not created by this subtask):**
        ```markdown
        | Defect ID | Title/Summary                      | Module/Feature | TC ID (Optional) | Severity | Priority | Status | Reported By | Date Reported | Description                               | Steps to Reproduce                       | Expected Result | Actual Result | Environment                                | Assigned To (Dev) | Resolution Notes (Dev) |
        |-----------|------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
        | BUG_001   | Login fails with correct user/pass | User Accounts  | TC_USR_001       | Critical | High     | Open   | Jules - QA  | YYYY-MM-DD    | User cannot log in despite valid creds. | 1. Go to login page...                   | User logs in.   | Error message. | Local Docker, Chrome vXX                     | TBD               |                        |
        ```
*   **Severity Levels (Example Definitions):**
    *   **Critical:** Application crash, data loss or corruption, major security vulnerability, or a core feature is completely blocked with no workaround.
    *   **High:** A key feature is significantly impaired or unusable, or a major deviation from requirements. A difficult or no workaround exists.
    *   **Medium:** A feature is not working as expected but a workaround exists, or a non-critical feature is failing. Moderate UI/usability issues affecting user experience.
    *   **Low:** Minor UI defect (e.g., alignment, typo, color issue), cosmetic issue, or minor deviation not impacting overall functionality.
*   **Priority Levels (Example Definitions):**
    *   **High:** The defect must be fixed as soon as possible as it impacts critical functionality or user experience.
    *   **Medium:** The defect should be addressed in the normal course of development.
    *   **Low:** The defect can be fixed if time permits or deferred to a later release.
*   **Defect Lifecycle (Conceptual):**
    1.  **Open:** Defect is reported and awaiting review.
    2.  **(Dev Triage):** Defect is reviewed, validated, and assigned (e.g., to a developer, or marked as duplicate/invalid/deferred).
    3.  **(Dev) In Progress:** Developer is actively working on a fix.
    4.  **(Dev) Resolved / Fixed:** Developer has implemented a fix and deployed it to the test environment.
    5.  **(QA) Retest / Verification:** QA retests the defect to confirm the fix.
    6.  **Closed:** If the retest passes, the defect is closed.
    7.  **Reopened:** If the retest fails, the defect is reopened and assigned back to the developer with details.

## 5. Criteria for Test Cycle Completion ("Verification Complete" - Conceptual)

The test cycle for a given release or milestone will be considered complete when:
*   All High and Medium priority functional test cases from `FUNCTIONAL_TEST_CASES.md` have been executed at least once.
*   All reported Critical and High severity defects have been resolved, retested, and closed.
*   A mutually agreed-upon percentage (e.g., >90%) of Medium severity defects have been resolved, retested, and closed. Low severity defects may be deferred.
*   Key localization checks for Arabic (RTL layout, core translations for critical paths) have passed.
*   The usability review (heuristic evaluation) has been completed, and any major usability concerns have been addressed or acknowledged.
*   A Test Summary Report is prepared by QA, outlining the testing scope, activities performed, summary of results, list of outstanding defects, and an overall quality assessment.
*   QA lead (Jules) provides a sign-off or recommendation based on the test results and overall risk assessment.

This strategy provides a structured approach to test execution and defect management, aiming to ensure a thorough evaluation of the Amazon Listing Optimizer application.The `TEST_EXECUTION_AND_REPORTING_STRATEGY.md` file has been created successfully.

It includes the following sections:

1.  **Introduction:** Purpose and references to other key testing documents.
2.  **Test Environment Setup (Recap):** Use of `docker-compose` local environment and the need for configured API keys.
3.  **Test Execution Process (Manual):**
    *   **Functional Test Execution:** Systematic execution of test cases, recording results, and marking status.
    *   **Non-Functional Test Execution (integrated with Functional):** Covering usability observations, localization checks (English/Arabic, RTL), basic security conceptual review, and performance observations.
    *   **Test Data Management:** Use of predefined test data and modification as needed.
4.  **Defect Reporting and Tracking (Conceptual):**
    *   **Defect Definition.**
    *   **Reporting Mechanism:** Suggestion for a `DEFECT_LOG.md` (template provided conceptually within the document).
    *   **Severity Levels:** Critical, High, Medium, Low (with example definitions).
    *   **Priority Levels:** High, Medium, Low (with example definitions).
    *   **Defect Lifecycle:** Open -> (Dev Triage) -> (Dev) In Progress -> (Dev) Resolved -> (QA) Retest -> Closed / Reopened.
5.  **Criteria for Test Cycle Completion ("Verification Complete" - Conceptual):** Execution coverage, defect resolution status, localization checks, usability review, QA report, and sign-off.

This document provides a clear, albeit conceptual, framework for how testing would be practically conducted and how defects would be managed for the Amazon Listing Optimizer application.
