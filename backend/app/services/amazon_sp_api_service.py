# --- Conceptual SP-API Authentication Flow ---
# 1. LWA Token Exchange:
#    - The application (client) needs to exchange an LWA (Login with Amazon) authorization grant
#      (obtained from the seller through an OAuth consent flow) for an LWA refresh token and an initial LWA access token.
#    - This refresh token is long-lived and must be securely stored by the application.
#    - The access token is short-lived (e.g., 1 hour).
#
# 2. LWA Access Token Generation (using Refresh Token):
#    - Before making SP-API calls, the application requests a fresh LWA access token using its LWA client ID,
#      client secret, and the seller's stored LWA refresh token.
#    - Endpoint: https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token
#    - Body: grant_type=refresh_token, refresh_token=<refresh_token>, client_id=<lwa_app_id>, client_secret=<lwa_client_secret>
#
# 3. LWA Token Refresh:
#    - The LWA refresh token itself might expire or be revoked, although this is less frequent.
#    - Robust applications should have a mechanism to detect an invalid refresh token and guide the seller
#      to re-authorize the application to get a new refresh token.
#
# 4. Making SP-API Calls:
#    - All SP-API calls require the LWA access token in the `x-amz-access-token` header.
#    - Requests also need to be signed using AWS Signature Version 4, using either:
#        a) IAM User credentials (AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key) that have permissions to execute SP-API.
#        b) Security Token Service (STS) temporary credentials obtained by assuming an IAM Role
#           (using `SPAPI_ROLE_ARN`). This is the recommended approach for security.
#           The LWA access token can be used to request these temporary credentials if the IAM role
#           has a trust policy allowing the SP-API application principal.
#
# Note: The `python-amazon-sp-api` SDK handles much of this complexity internally if configured correctly,
# especially the LWA token refresh and request signing. However, the initial refresh token MUST be obtained
# and securely stored by the application.

# --- Conceptual Structure for updated_data ---
# This is what the API endpoint might receive from the frontend.
# {
#     "title": "New Optimized Title For Product XYZ",
#     "bullet_points": [
#         "Optimized Bullet Point 1: Highlighting key KSA feature.",
#         "Optimized Bullet Point 2: Emphasizing quality and local relevance.",
#         "Optimized Bullet Point 3: Includes important warranty information for KSA."
#     ],
#     "description": "This is the new, comprehensive, and culturally adapted product description,
#                   tailored for the Saudi Arabian market. It elaborates on benefits, usage scenarios,
#                   and why this product is a great fit for customers in KSA."
# }
#
# This `updated_data` then needs to be transformed into the SP-API's JSON Patch format
# for the ListingsItemPutSubmission operation. For example:
# [
#   { "op": "replace", "path": "/attributes/title", "value": [{"value": "New Optimized Title...", "language_tag": "ar_AE" or "en_US"}] },
#   { "op": "replace", "path": "/attributes/bullet_point", "value": [
#       {"value": "Bullet 1", "language_tag": "ar_AE"}, {"value": "Bullet 2", "language_tag": "ar_AE"}
#   ]},
#   { "op": "replace", "path": "/attributes/description", "value": [{"value": "Description...", "language_tag": "ar_AE"}] }
# ]
# The exact 'path' and 'value' structure depends on the specific attributes being updated and the product type.
# Language tag (e.g., "ar_AE" for UAE/KSA, "en_US") is crucial. Amazon might use "en_AE" or expect specific tags.
