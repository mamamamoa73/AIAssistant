## 1. Introduction & Objectives

**Purpose:**
This Test Plan outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the Amazon Listing Optimizer application. The goal is to ensure a high-quality product that meets specified requirements and provides a reliable user experience for optimizing Amazon product listings, particularly for the KSA market.

**Overall QA Objectives:**
*   Ensure the application functionalities (content generation, PAAPI/SP-API integration, i18n, etc.) perform as designed.
*   Identify and report defects to improve application quality.
*   Verify that the application is user-friendly and suitable for the target KSA market.
*   Confirm that data is processed and displayed accurately.
*   Validate the application against the defined UI/UX flows and business requirements.

**Reference:**
This Test Plan refers to the `QA_SCOPE_DOCUMENT.md` for detailed scope definitions.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1. Features to be Tested:
The following key features will be tested, as derived from `QA_SCOPE_DOCUMENT.md`:
*   **User Account Management:** (Assuming basic implementation) Login, Logout. (Registration, Profile, Password Reset if implemented).
*   **Product Input:**
    *   ASIN input with data fetching via Amazon Product Advertising API (PAAPI).
    *   Manual product data input (name, key features, target audience).

    *   User interface in English and Arabic.
    *   Right-to-Left (RTL) layout for the Arabic language.
    *   Functionality of the language switcher.

### 2.2. Features Not to be Tested:
The following are explicitly out of scope for this testing cycle (as per `QA_SCOPE_DOCUMENT.md`):
*   Full Performance, Load, or Stress Testing.
*   In-depth Security Penetration Testing.
*   Automated End-to-End (E2E) test script execution (though test cases might be designed for future automation).
*   Testing of live SP-API integration beyond the mocked responses (due to its current placeholder nature).
*   Database migration testing (assuming stable schema for MVP).
*   Specific infrastructure testing of the cloud deployment environment beyond basic deployment verification.
*   Live OpenAI API call validation for all possible scenarios (focus on integration and mock responses).
*   Detailed validation of the PAAPI Python SDK's internal logic (focus on data passthrough).

## 3. Test Strategy (High-Level)

The testing will encompass several levels to ensure comprehensive coverage:
*   **Functional Testing:** Verifying that each feature works as specified in the requirements and UI/UX flows. This will be the primary focus.
*   **UI/UX Testing:** Ensuring the user interface is intuitive, elements are displayed correctly, and the user experience is smooth. This includes checking for visual consistency and adherence to `UI_UX_FLOW.md`.
*   **Basic API Validation (Conceptual):** While detailed backend API testing is covered in `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` (with `pytest`), during functional testing, we will observe API interactions from the frontend to ensure correct data is sent and responses are handled gracefully. This involves checking payloads in browser dev tools and observing behavior.
*   **Localization Testing:** Validating the application in English and Arabic, including RTL layout and correct translation rendering.
*   **Usability Testing (Heuristic Evaluation):** Assessing overall ease of use, clarity, and efficiency.

Reference to `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` should be made for detailed backend (pytest unit/integration) and frontend (Vitest/React Testing Library unit/integration) specific strategies.

## 4. Test Environment (Conceptual)

*   **Application Setup:** The application (frontend and backend) running locally via `docker-compose`. This ensures a consistent environment reflecting the containerized setup.
*   **Backend Configuration:**
    *   `.env` file for the backend populated with valid (test/dev) API keys for Amazon PAAPI and OpenAI.
    *   SP-API credentials will use mock/placeholder values as the integration is not live.
*   **Frontend Configuration:**
    *   The frontend should be configured to communicate with the local backend service.
*   **Browsers:** Latest stable versions of:
    *   Google Chrome
    *   Mozilla Firefox
    *   Microsoft Edge
*   **Tools:** Browser developer tools for inspecting network requests, console logs, and UI elements.

## 5. Test Data Requirements

*   **Valid KSA ASINs:** A list of 3-5 valid ASINs for products listed on `amazon.sa` across different categories to test PAAPI data fetching.
*   **Invalid/Non-existent ASINs:** 2-3 examples to test error handling for PAAPI.
*   **Sample Manual Product Data:**
    *   Product names, key features, categories, target audiences in English.
    *   Equivalent data in Arabic.
    *   Data with special characters or long strings to test input handling.
*   **KSA-Specific Keywords:** A list of relevant keywords in both English and Arabic for testing the custom keyword feature and conceptual KSA keyword trend integration.
*   **User Account Credentials (if applicable):** Test usernames and passwords for login functionality.
*   **OpenAI API Key:** A valid API key (preferably for a test/dev account with low usage limits) for testing live AI generation if not solely relying on mocked backend responses.
*   **PAAPI Credentials:** Valid credentials for the KSA marketplace.
*   **Seller SKUs:** Sample SKUs for testing the (mocked) SP-API update functionality.

## 6. Test Case Design Approach

*   **Positive Testing (Happy Path):** Test cases will be designed to verify that features work as expected with valid inputs and under normal operating conditions.
*   **Negative Testing (Error Conditions):** Test cases will cover scenarios with invalid inputs, unexpected user actions, and potential error conditions to ensure the application handles them gracefully (e.g., displays appropriate error messages).
*   **Test Case Structure:** Each test case will include:
    *   **Test Case ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., `TC_MOD_XXX`).
    *   **Description:** A brief summary of the test objective.
    *   **Priority:** High, Medium, or Low, indicating the importance of the test case.
    *   **Preconditions:** Any conditions that must be met before executing the test.
    *   **Test Steps:** Detailed steps to execute the test.
    *   **Expected Results:** The anticipated outcome after executing the test steps.
    *   **(Optional) Actual Results:** To be filled during execution.
    *   **(Optional) Status:** Pass/Fail.

## 7. Entry Criteria (Conceptual)

*   The development team confirms the stability of the build in the test environment.
*   All necessary test data (ASINs, sample product info, keywords, API keys) is available and configured.
*   Key documentation (UI/UX flow, API specifications from Pydantic models, `AI_PROMPTS.md`) is available for reference.
*   The test environment (Docker setup, browser versions) is ready.

## 8. Exit Criteria (Conceptual)

*   100% execution of all High priority functional test cases.
*   At least 90% execution of Medium priority functional test cases.
*   No outstanding Critical or High severity defects in core application functionalities.
*   All localization test cases for English and Arabic (including RTL) have been executed and passed.
*   Key usability heuristics have been reviewed and major issues addressed.
*   A test summary report is prepared and shared with stakeholders.

## 9. Roles & Responsibilities (Conceptual)

*   **QA Engineer (Jules):**
    *   Overall test planning and strategy refinement.
    *   Design and documentation of test cases.
    *   (Conceptual) Oversight of test execution.
    *   Defect reporting, tracking, and verification.
    *   Communication of test status and results to the project team.
*   **Development Team:**
    *   Timely fixing of reported defects.
    *   Providing necessary information and support to the QA process.
    *   Unit and integration testing of their respective modules.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations (Conceptual)

*   **Risk:** Limited access to a live, fully representative KSA Amazon environment for PAAPI/SP-API.
    *   **Mitigation:** Maximize use of PAAPI sandbox environments if available. For SP-API, rely heavily on thorough testing of the mock responses and frontend interaction. Clearly document that live SP-API updates are not fully tested.
*   **Risk:** Subjectivity in assessing the quality/relevance of AI-generated content.
    *   **Mitigation:** Testing will focus on the functional correctness of the AI integration (i.e., prompts are constructed correctly based on inputs, content is generated and displayed) and adherence to guidelines in `AI_PROMPTS.md`. Qualitative assessment will be secondary and noted as such.
*   **Risk:** Variability in PAAPI data structure for different products/categories.
    *   **Mitigation:** Test with ASINs from diverse categories. Log actual PAAPI responses during testing to understand variations and adapt if necessary (though extensive adaptation is out of MVP scope).
*   **Risk:** Time constraints for comprehensive testing of all edge cases.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize test cases based on risk and impact (High, Medium, Low). Focus on core functionalities and critical paths.
*   **Risk:** Dependency on external API availability (OpenAI, PAAPI).
    *   **Mitigation:** Use mock data and mocked service responses for scenarios where external APIs might be unavailable or rate-limited, especially for automated checks.

This Test Plan provides a framework for the QA activities to ensure the Amazon Listing Optimizer meets its quality goals.Okay, I have created the `TEST_PLAN.md` file.

Now, I will proceed to create the `FUNCTIONAL_TEST_CASES.md` file. It will include example test cases for several modules and list all modules that need test case coverage.
