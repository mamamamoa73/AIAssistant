# System Architecture: AI-Powered Amazon Listing Optimization Tool

This document outlines the system architecture for the AI-powered Amazon listing optimization tool.

## 1. High-Level API Architecture

The system is designed as a modular, service-oriented architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

**Core Components:**

*   **Frontend (e.g., Bolt AI Interface):**
    *   **Role:** Provides the user interface for interaction. Users input product information (ASINs, keywords, existing text), select optimization preferences (e.g., target language - Arabic for KSA, desired tone - persuasive, formal), and view optimized listing suggestions. It also allows users to manage their connected Amazon accounts.
*   **Backend API Gateway:**
    *   **Role:** Acts as the single entry point for all client requests from the Frontend. It routes requests to the appropriate backend services, handles authentication and authorization, and aggregates responses. This simplifies the frontend's interaction with the backend and provides a centralized point for cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting and logging.
*   **Listing Optimization Service:**
    *   **Role:** This is the core orchestration engine. It receives optimization requests from the API Gateway, coordinates data retrieval from Amazon APIs, prepares data for the AI model, interacts with the OpenAI GPT API Connector for content generation, and processes the results. It also handles the logic for incorporating KSA market insights and user preferences into the optimization process.
*   **Amazon Product Advertising API Connector:**
    *   **Role:** A dedicated module responsible for interacting with the Amazon Product Advertising API. Its primary function is to fetch public product information, such as existing listing details, competitor data, and keyword search volumes, based on ASINs or search terms.
*   **Amazon Selling Partner API Connector:**
    *   **Role:** A dedicated module for interacting with the Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API). This connector handles seller-specific data, including retrieving current listings directly from a seller's account, updating listings with optimized content, and managing inventory or pricing data (though the latter is out of scope for initial listing optimization). Requires secure OAuth2 authentication.
*   **OpenAI GPT API Connector:**
    *   **Role:** A module responsible for all communications with the OpenAI GPT API. It formats requests (prompts) based on instructions from the Listing Optimization Service, sends them to the GPT model, and receives the generated text (e.g., titles, bullet points, descriptions). It handles API key management and error handling related to OpenAI interactions.
*   **Database:**
    *   **Role:** A persistent storage solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a NoSQL alternative like MongoDB) used to store:
        *   User account information and authentication tokens.
        *   Connected Amazon seller account details (encrypted).
        *   Original product listing data fetched from Amazon.
        *   Optimized listing content generated by the AI.
        *   User preferences for optimization (language, tone, specific keywords to include/exclude).
        *   KSA market insights, such as trending keywords, seasonal terms, and culturally relevant phrases.
        *   Optimization history and versioning of generated content.

**Communication Pathways (Text Illustration):**

1.  **User Interaction:**
    `Frontend <--> Backend API Gateway`
    *   User inputs ASIN, preferences, and initiates optimization via the Frontend.
    *   Frontend sends request to Backend API Gateway.

2.  **Request Orchestration:**
    `Backend API Gateway --> Listing Optimization Service`
    *   API Gateway authenticates and forwards the request to the Listing Optimization Service.

3.  **Fetching Product Data (Public):**
    `Listing Optimization Service --> Amazon Product Advertising API Connector --> Amazon Product Advertising API`
    *   Listing Optimization Service requests public product data for the given ASIN.

4.  **Fetching Product Data (Seller-Specific, if applicable):**
    `Listing Optimization Service --> Amazon Selling Partner API Connector --> Amazon Selling Partner API`
    *   If the user has connected their account, Listing Optimization Service requests current listing details.

5.  **Fetching KSA Market Insights & User Preferences:**
    `Listing Optimization Service --> Database`
    *   Listing Optimization Service retrieves relevant KSA keywords, user-defined settings, and previous optimization data.

6.  **Content Generation:**
    `Listing Optimization Service --> OpenAI GPT API Connector --> OpenAI GPT API`
    *   Listing Optimization Service constructs detailed prompts (including product data, KSA insights, user preferences).
    *   OpenAI GPT API Connector sends prompts to OpenAI and receives optimized text.

7.  **Storing Optimized Content:**
    `Listing Optimization Service --> Database`
    *   The generated content and original versions are stored for history and user review.

8.  **Returning Results to User:**
    `Listing Optimization Service --> Backend API Gateway --> Frontend`
    *   Optimized suggestions are sent back through the API Gateway to be displayed on the Frontend.

9.  **Updating Listing on Amazon (User-Initiated):**
    `Frontend --> Backend API Gateway --> Listing Optimization Service --> Amazon Selling Partner API Connector --> Amazon Selling Partner API`
    *   User approves optimized content.
    *   Request to update is sent via Frontend to API Gateway.
    *   Listing Optimization Service instructs Selling Partner API Connector to update the listing on Amazon.

This high-level architecture promotes separation of concerns, making the system easier to develop, test, and scale. Each connector (Amazon APIs, OpenAI API) acts as an abstraction layer, insulating the core Listing Optimization Service from the specifics of external API changes.

## 2. Data Flow

This section details the movement of data through the system during the listing optimization process.

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    1.  **Public Product Data:** When a user provides an ASIN, the `Listing Optimization Service` triggers the `Amazon Product Advertising API Connector`.
    2.  This connector queries the Amazon Product Advertising API for publicly available product details (e.g., current title, description, bullet points, images, basic competitor information).
    3.  The fetched data is returned to the `Listing Optimization Service`.
    4.  **Seller-Specific Data:** If the user has connected their Amazon Seller Central account (via OAuth2 through the `Amazon Selling Partner API Connector`), the `Listing Optimization Service` can request existing listing data directly from the seller's account.
    5.  The `Amazon Selling Partner API Connector` interacts with the SP-API to retrieve this private data, which might include more detailed backend information or draft listings not yet public.
    6.  This data is also returned to the `Listing Optimization Service`.

*   **User Input:**
    1.  Users interact with the **Frontend** (e.g., Bolt AI interface).
    2.  They input one or more ASINs for the products they want to optimize.
    3.  They can also provide existing product text if they don't want to fetch it directly from Amazon, or if they have a new product.
    4.  Users select optimization preferences:
        *   **Target Language:** e.g., Arabic for KSA.
        *   **Desired Tone:** e.g., persuasive, informative, formal, friendly.
        *   **Specific Keywords:** Keywords to prioritize or exclude.
        *   **Target Audience:** (Optional) e.g., tech-savvy, budget-conscious.
    5.  These inputs are packaged by the Frontend and sent as a request to the `Backend API Gateway`, which then forwards it to the `Listing Optimization Service`.

*   **Optimization Process:**
    1.  The `Listing Optimization Service` receives the product data (from Amazon APIs or direct input) and user preferences.
    2.  It retrieves relevant KSA market insights (e.g., trending keywords, cultural nuances for Arabic, seasonal terms) from the **Database**.
    3.  **Prompt Construction:** The service constructs detailed prompts for the OpenAI GPT model. These prompts are carefully engineered to include:
        *   The original product information (title, description, bullet points).
        *   User-specified keywords and desired tone.
        *   Instructions for the target language (Arabic).
        *   KSA market insights (e.g., "Incorporate terms like 'عروض' (offers) if relevant for a sales context in KSA").
        *   Specific output requirements (e.g., "Generate 5 bullet points, each under 150 characters. Generate a product title under 200 characters. Generate a product description between 1000-2000 characters.").
    4.  The `Listing Optimization Service` sends these structured prompts to the `OpenAI GPT API Connector`.
    5.  The `OpenAI GPT API Connector` formats the request according to OpenAI's API specifications, includes the necessary API key, and sends it to the designated GPT model (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo).
    6.  The OpenAI API processes the prompt and returns the generated, optimized content (new title, bullet points, description in Arabic).
    7.  The `OpenAI GPT API Connector` receives this response and passes it back to the `Listing Optimization Service`.
    8.  The `Listing Optimization Service` may perform minor post-processing if needed (e.g., basic formatting checks).

*   **Data Storage:**
    The **Database** is crucial for storing various pieces of information:
    *   **User Accounts:** User credentials, Bolt AI integration details.
    *   **Amazon Account Connections:** Securely stored OAuth tokens for SP-API access.
    *   **Original Product Data:** A snapshot of the product listing (title, bullets, description, ASIN, marketplace) before optimization.
    *   **Optimized Content:** The AI-generated listing versions, along with the prompts used to create them. Multiple versions might be stored if the user iterates.
    *   **User Preferences:** Saved settings for language, tone, and custom keywords for each user or product.
    *   **KSA Market Insights:** A curated list of KSA-specific keywords, seasonal trends, relevant cultural phrases, and potentially competitor data insights. This data can be updated periodically.
    *   **Optimization History:** Logs of optimization jobs, timestamps, and versions.

*   **Content Update (User-Initiated):**
    1.  The optimized content is displayed to the user on the **Frontend**.
    2.  If the user approves the suggestions, they can trigger an update to their Amazon listing.
    3.  The Frontend sends an "update listing" request (with the approved content and ASIN) to the `Backend API Gateway`.
    4.  The Gateway routes this to the `Listing Optimization Service`.
    5.  The `Listing Optimization Service` then instructs the `Amazon Selling Partner API Connector` to submit the new content to Amazon via the SP-API, using the user's authenticated connection.
    6.  The connector handles the API calls required to update the specific sections of the listing (title, bullet points, description) on Amazon Seller Central.

*   **Feedback Loop (Future Enhancement):**
    1.  **User Feedback Collection:** The Frontend could include mechanisms for users to rate the quality of generated content (e.g., thumbs up/down, star rating, short comments) or to indicate which suggestions they accepted, modified, or rejected.
    2.  **Data Storage:** This feedback would be stored in the **Database**, linked to the specific generated content and the prompts used.
    3.  **Analysis and Refinement:** The `Listing Optimization Service` (or a separate analytics component) could periodically analyze this feedback.
    4.  **Prompt Improvement:** Insights from feedback can be used to refine the prompt engineering strategies. For example, if users consistently reject titles that are too long, the default length constraint in prompts can be adjusted.
    5.  **Model Fine-tuning (Advanced):** In a more advanced scenario, aggregated and anonymized feedback could potentially be used to fine-tune a custom AI model, although this is a significant undertaking.
    6.  This iterative process helps improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated suggestions over time.

## 3. Modularity for Future Expansion (e.g., other regional marketplaces)

The architecture is designed with modularity in mind to facilitate future expansion to other regional marketplaces (e.g., UAE, Europe, North America) and to incorporate new features with minimal disruption.

*   **API Abstraction:**
    *   **Role:** Each external API connector (`Amazon Product Advertising API Connector`, `Amazon Selling Partner API Connector`, `OpenAI GPT API Connector`) is an independent module.
    *   **Benefit:** These connectors abstract the specific implementation details of the external APIs. If Amazon changes its API endpoints for a specific region (e.g., a different base URL for Amazon.co.uk vs. Amazon.sa) or if we decide to use a different AI provider, only the relevant connector module needs to be updated or replaced. The core `Listing Optimization Service` logic remains largely unaffected. Configuration parameters within these connectors (e.g., endpoint URLs, API versions) can be externalized.

*   **Localization Service/Module:**
    *   **Role:** Introduce a dedicated `Localization Service` (or a well-defined module within the `Listing Optimization Service` initially). This component would be responsible for:
        *   Managing translations if the UI or internal data needs to be presented in multiple languages.
        *   Adapting prompt engineering strategies for different cultural contexts. For instance, persuasive language in one culture might differ significantly from another.
        *   Integrating region-specific keyword databases and market insights. While initially focused on KSA, this service would manage similar data for other marketplaces.
        *   Handling different character sets, text direction (e.g., RTL for Arabic), and formatting requirements for various languages.
    *   **Benefit:** New regions can be supported by adding new language packs, cultural adaptation rules, and market insight data sources to this service without deep changes to the core optimization logic. The `Listing Optimization Service` would query the `Localization Service` for region-specific information.

*   **Configuration-Driven Approach:**
    *   **Role:** Key operational and regional settings will be stored in configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) or a dedicated configuration table in the database. This includes:
        *   Amazon API endpoints for different regions.
        *   Language codes (e.g., "ar-SA", "en-GB", "de-DE").
        *   Default prompt templates or fragments that can be customized per region.
        *   Paths to market-specific keyword lists or databases.
        *   Credentials or identifiers for different Amazon Marketplace IDs.
    *   **Benefit:** Adding support for a new region becomes primarily a task of updating these configurations and potentially adding new data to the `Localization Service`, rather than extensive code modification. This significantly speeds up expansion.

*   **Database Schema for Multi-Region Support:**
    *   **Design:** The database schema will be designed to accommodate region-specific data from the outset.
        *   Tables storing user preferences, product data, and optimized content will include fields like `marketplace_id` (e.g., "A13V1IB3VIYZZH" for Amazon.it) or `region_code` (e.g., "KSA", "UK").
        *   The `KSA Market Insights` data will be structured as a specific instance of more general "Market Insights" data, partitionable or filterable by region.
    *   **Benefit:** This allows for clear separation and retrieval of data pertinent to specific marketplaces, ensuring that optimizations for one region do not incorrectly influence another.

*   **Scalability with Microservices (Future Consideration):**
    *   **Concept:** For very large-scale operations or if specific components become bottlenecks, the architecture allows for certain services to be broken out into independent microservices.
    *   **Potential Candidates:**
        *   `Listing Optimization Service`: Could be scaled independently if processing load becomes very high.
        *   `Localization Service`: If it grows complex with many regions and linguistic tasks.
        *   `Market Insights Service`: Could become a dedicated service responsible for gathering, processing, and serving market trend data from various sources for all supported regions.
        *   The API Connectors (`Amazon Product Advertising API Connector`, `Amazon Selling Partner API Connector`, `OpenAI GPT API Connector`) are already conceptually separate and could be deployed as individual microservices if needed, each with its own scaling policies.
    *   **Benefit:** Microservices offer independent scaling, deployment, and development, improving resilience and allowing teams to work on different parts of the system in parallel. However, this adds complexity in terms of deployment and inter-service communication, so it's considered a future-proofing strategy rather than an initial requirement for a lightweight tool.

By implementing these modular design principles, the system can adapt to new requirements, integrate with different regional marketplaces, and scale effectively as the user base and feature set grow. The initial focus will be on clear separation of concerns within a monolithic or service-oriented backend, with the option to evolve towards microservices if justified by scale.
