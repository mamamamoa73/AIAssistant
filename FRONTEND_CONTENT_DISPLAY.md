# Frontend: Optimized Content Display & Copy Functionality

This document details the enhancements made to the frontend for displaying optimized content received from the backend and implementing "Copy to Clipboard" functionality. This builds upon the MVP UI setup.

## 1. Displaying Optimized Content

*   **File Affected:** `frontend/src/pages/OptimizationPage.jsx`

*   **State Management:**
    *   A new state variable `optimizedData` (initialized to `null`) was introduced to specifically store the `data` object from a successful API response (e.g., `{ optimized_title: "...", optimized_bullet_points: [...], ... }`).
    *   The `handleSubmit` function was updated:
        *   On successful API response (`response.status === 'success'`), `setOptimizedData(response.data)` is called.
        *   If the API indicates an error (`response.status === 'error'`) or if an error occurs during the API call, `optimizedData` is set to `null` and the `error` state is updated with the relevant message.

*   **UI Implementation:**
    *   A new section titled "Optimized Content" is rendered conditionally, only appearing if `optimizedData` is not `null`. This section is wrapped in an MUI `Paper` component for visual grouping and elevation.
    *   **Title:**
        *   Displayed using an MUI `Typography` component (`variant="h6"`).
        *   The actual title text is nested within another `Paper` component for a distinct background.
        *   Conditionally rendered if `optimizedData.optimized_title` exists.
    *   **Bullet Points:**
        *   Displayed using an MUI `Typography` component (`variant="h6"`) for the section title ("Bullet Points:").
        *   If `optimizedData.optimized_bullet_points` exists and is an array with items, each bullet point is rendered within an MUI `List`. Each point is a `ListItem` within its own `Paper` component, providing a clear visual separation for each bullet.
        *   Conditionally rendered.
    *   **Description:**
        *   Displayed using an MUI `Typography` component (`variant="h6"`).
        *   The description text is rendered within a `Paper` component with `whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'` style to preserve formatting.
        *   Conditionally rendered if `optimizedData.optimized_description` exists.

## 2. "Copy to Clipboard" Functionality

*   **File Affected:** `frontend/src/pages/OptimizationPage.jsx`

*   **Implementation:**
    *   A helper function `handleCopyToClipboard(textToCopy, label)` was added:
        *   It uses the asynchronous `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API to copy the provided `textToCopy`.
        *   The `label` argument (e.g., "Title", "Bullet Point 1") is used for user feedback.
    *   **User Feedback:**
        *   An MUI `Snackbar` component was added to the page.
        *   New state variables `snackbarOpen` (boolean) and `snackbarMessage` (string) control the Snackbar's visibility and message.
        *   On successful copy, `snackbarMessage` is set to e.g., "Title copied to clipboard!", and `snackbarOpen` is set to `true`.
        *   On failure (e.g., clipboard API not available or permission denied), an appropriate error message is shown in the Snackbar.
    *   **Copy Buttons:**
        *   MUI `Button` components with a `ContentCopyIcon` are placed next to:
            *   The optimized title.
            *   Each individual bullet point.
            *   An "Copy All" button for bullet points (copies all bullet points joined by newlines).
            *   The optimized description.
        *   The `onClick` handler of each button calls `handleCopyToClipboard` with the corresponding text from `optimizedData`.

## 3. Error Display Confirmation

*   **File Affected:** `frontend/src/pages/OptimizationPage.jsx`

*   The existing error display mechanism using an MUI `Alert` with `severity="error"` remains in place.
*   The `handleSubmit` function's error handling was refined:
    *   If the API response contains `status: "error"` and an `error_message`, this message is displayed.
    *   If the `callOptimizeApi` service throws an error (e.g., network error, non-2xx response not caught by the service's internal logic), the `catch` block in `handleSubmit` sets the error message, which is then displayed in the Alert.
    *   The `Alert` component uses `whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'` to ensure error messages with newlines are displayed correctly.

## 4. Styling and Layout

*   The "Optimized Content" section and its sub-parts (title, bullets, description) use MUI `Paper` components with `variant="outlined"` and a light grey background (`backgroundColor: 'grey.50'`) for a subtle visual distinction and grouping.
*   MUI `Stack` and `Grid` components are used for layout, ensuring responsive arrangement of elements.
*   Copy buttons are positioned to be clearly associated with the content they act upon. Individual bullet point copy buttons are smaller and use `variant="text"` for a less intrusive look.
*   Responsive padding (`sx={{ p: { xs: 2, md: 3 } }}`) is applied to the main content containers for better viewing on different screen sizes.

This set of enhancements allows users to clearly see the optimized content generated by the (currently mocked) backend and easily copy it for their use, with appropriate feedback mechanisms.The `FRONTEND_CONTENT_DISPLAY.md` file has been created successfully.

The frontend `OptimizationPage.jsx` has been updated to:
1.  Store and display the `optimized_title`, `optimized_bullet_points`, and `optimized_description` from the API response using MUI components (`Typography`, `List`, `ListItem`, `Paper`).
2.  Conditionally render these sections based on data availability.
3.  Implement "Copy to Clipboard" functionality using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` for the title, each bullet point, all bullet points as a block, and the description.
4.  Provide user feedback for copy actions using an MUI `Snackbar`.
5.  Refine error display using MUI `Alert` to show messages from the API or from network/request errors.
6.  Improve layout and styling for the displayed content using `Paper`, `Stack`, and responsive padding.

All requirements for this subtask have been met.
